## About this project

I'll be using this project to demonstrate my ability to write CRUD application using laravel and MariaDB. For front-end I'll be using vue, to demonstrate my understanding of vue router & components. The front-end will not be customized & will contain only bootstrap components, as I'll be using a different application to show my [SCSS/CSS](https://github.com/erlandocv/erlando-cv).

## Index page
